<h1> Summary:</h1>
<p>The best way to understand the backend side is to imagine that you are sharing a post on any social platform and think that different people comment on the posts you have shared.
Here in this project, the back-end side of these processes is coded.Also, since you know that you cannot use any of its operations without logging into any site, it requests you to log in.
I am doing these operations in my AuthController class by using the same operations from Spring Security Rest API and JWT feature.

<h1> RDBM Relationship Explaining:</h1>
Relationship between Post and Comment is OneToMany and ManyToOne.
